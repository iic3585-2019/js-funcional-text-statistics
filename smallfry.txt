“At the beginning of these mounting arguments, I would try to reason with her, in case I
could calm her down. Later, when it was clear she wouldn’t
stop, when it was clear that the fight would go on
and on, I stood very still and stopped speaking.


A few times before, the phone had rung at the
beginning of a fight, interrupting it; she took the
call in her room, where I could hear muffled noises.
Her friend Michael or Terry had called. Later, when
she came to say goodnight, she was no longer
upset. I was innocent, I thought, her unhappiness
nothing to do with me—she was lonely. This is
what I believed and told myself when she started
screaming, and it was one of my excuses for being
lazy with the dishes, and unhelpful around the
house, and contemptuous of her.”
